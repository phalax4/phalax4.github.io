1. **What did you do this past week?**
This week I met up with my group to finish up the presentation for IDB, and going through what we wanted to each say. I also reviewed through the quizzes and code slides in anticipation for the upcoming test. And I am in the middle of making the notes sheets and refining some concepts that I found still confusing.

2. **What's in your way?**
Certain concepts that came off as a tad confusing are still in my way after going through them. This includes the decorator over the class and some of the design patterns. I also still have particular trouble with covariance. I am worried about the test and what to expect since we covered more non-python things this time around and some of the SQL stuff such as aggregation is still a little confusing.

3. **What will you do next week?**
I plan on finishing up my notes sheet for the exam as well as going through the refactoring book. I still also need to review through the design patterns more thoroughly. Overall though I can't put as much effort into studying as I will be balancing out the time with the 2 other finals I have this week.

4. **What's my experience of the class?**
The final project was very satisfactory in terms of what it is and the whole team aspect of it. Overall the class does cover a wide range of topics, and the talks are good supplements. The experience with the XML and SQL portions was ok, I felt that there could have been less emphasis needed on the SQL portion.

5. **What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
**Tip of the Week:** I thought this was pretty cool way to host your app
