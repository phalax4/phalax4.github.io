#### Wrap up
1.What did you do this past week?
I studied the oop book a lot this week. There were a lot of concepts in the book that related to class in some small way but I felt like it was important. I also studied the past quizzes and I am working on the google doc code. The past week was pretty much just studying for the upcoming test and trying to piece everything together.
2.What's in your way?
The different handle class variations are confusing at times. Also the difference between the STL vector implementation and our implementation confuses me as well. Mainly the sequence of copy constructor vs copy assignment and things related to creation of the container and class elements confuses me because there is a lot of variation in it. I think I just need to better understand the under the hood implementation. 
3.What will you do next week?
Study more for the test and make my test sheet. Mainly it will be going over the code samples and google docs. I will also study vector a lot more. The shapes handle abstraction was a bit complicated so that will also be a priority. Other than that it will be writing things down to really grasp the explanations to everything.
**Tip of the Week:** Regular expressions are important to learn/
