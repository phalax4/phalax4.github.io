1. **What did you do this past week?**
This past week I wrapped up the final phase of the project with my group. I mainly worked on the frontend API wrapper and the javascript logic behind the search page. i had to do a lot of debugging to ensure that the query string was correctly communicated with the backend. In addition I spent a lot of time ensuring that the regex was parsing results correctly for a variety of input and that pagination worked correctly. I also looked through the refactoring book on certain parts.

2. **What's in your way?**
My main concern is that I really don't know what to study out of the refactoring book, since there is just so much content and methods in there. For the last phase we had less to do, so group communication was not as big of a problem but thereit was still an obstacle when certain things became backlogged.

3. **What will you do next week?**
I plan on starting to review the notes earlier in the semester, especially the SQL and the refactoring parts we have done. I also plan on working on the presentation with my group to get that out of the was as soon as possible. I also plan on starting to make the notes sheet and going through past quizzes.

4. **What's my experience of the class?**
I think the design patterns is a good way to wrap up the class. I enjoyed the end to end coverage of high level topics about software in general. The group working experience was interesting albeit a little chaotic, but still reflected a great aspect of the class.

5. **What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
**Tip of the Week:** An indepth look into a problem that people wouldn't normally look at,
