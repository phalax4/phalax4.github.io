1. **What did you do this past week?**
This past week I read the SQL online book that gave the crash course in everything SQL, as well as the ISP paper. I mostly had to study for other tests so I was not able to fully test out decorators, though I did check some decorator examples out. I thought that the notion of decorators used to simplify the memoization implementation was really neat. This past week my group also go together in person to start planning out the project and settling on the first few items of phase I. I attended all of the talks this past week as well and felt really suprised of the variety of services that live in a cloud platform ecosystem.

2. **What's in your way?**
Coordinating with teammates on who is going to do what since our slack chat is not too active seems to be the current challenge.

3. **What will you do next week?**
It is spring break so I plan on catching up with readings and classes. I also plan on getting more organized with the project team and putting in some sort of process to get work down and lastly to actually start the phase I work.

4. **What's my experience of the class?**
I like the talks as they have been extremely informative on technologies that I have not heard of before like the Redhat platform but they can be a bit too long for my liking as the presentation seems to start to drag on after about 45 min. Overall I am pleasantly suprised with the strange rules of python, and these nuances seem like novelties which keeps my interest in the language as a whole. 

5. **What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
**Tip of the Week:** Somone put a lot of effort into making this, so I thought it deserved to be shared.
