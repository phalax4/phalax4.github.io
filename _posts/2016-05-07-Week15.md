#### End
This class overall has been very helpful in introducing various tools and programming practices that are very practical.
I felt that all of the exams were fair and thoroughly tested the material in the class. I think I can easily apply
what we learned to future internships and a real job after that. I found learning about micoservices to be a interesting thing,
and I most likely would not have explored such a thing if not for learning about it in class. The projects starting from allocator
were fun and engaging and were great in introducing inner workings of c++. Although I did wish there was a little more guidance on the
whole handle thing from the start of the last project. The exams were a little nerve racking but I think what was
just because of being able to see that timer ticking down. I know it is hard to teach all of the nuances of a programming language, not
to mention even testing such knowledge in only a 50 minute block. But even then Professor Downing was still great in squeezing
everything in, in a very thorough manner. I think in the end I will be exploring more of C++ through making games
in Unreal engine and other libraries such as Quantlib and machinelearning in C++. Thank you for a great semester that mixed both
practical programming and theory together.

**Tip of the Week:** Docker in a microservice architecture
