1. **What did you do this past week?**
This past week I worked on the frontend of the last part of the project. Mainly implemented the search functionality with a focus on getting the results to display, and the frontend api wrapper to work. There was also a lot of debugging to get rid of some last minute bugs that had popped up. I also read more into regex to help with the search results project criteria. I spent a great deal of time on figuring out how to optimize the transpiled frontend client code so that the javascript would be as small as possible since loading times were getting worse.

2. **What's in your way?**
Integration of all the parts is still lacking in communication making it hard to get pieces done that depend on other pieces, especially when some testing depends on some other feature not implemented yet. Also the refactoring book is a bit hard to digest when reading which worries me for the test.

3. **What will you do next week?**
Next week I plan on re reading parts of the refactoring book since I am 100% sure that I did not understand a lot of the first time around, I also plan on wrapping up the frontend with the highlighting. The frontend pieces that I am working on also need to integrate into the backend which is also what I plan on getting done early next week.

4. **What's my experience of the class?**
The refactoring sounds good in learning when you hear about it, but actually reading the book gets tedious at times. However the concepts of Strategy Pattern and Singletons I think are a good intro to the design patterns of software engineering and worth learning about. I would have liked more experience in learning how to deal with working in larger teams more effectively.

5. **What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
**Tip of the Week:** Interesting open source project by Atlassian
