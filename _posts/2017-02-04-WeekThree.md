#### Project 1 onto to Project 2

1. **What did you do this past week?**
This past week I finished up the collatz project and mde sure everything was in order for the turn in. I also tried out the exercise code examples in the github repo so that I could do better on the quiz. To get a better feel for the possible exception paths, I coded up my own short example and tried out different scenarios, which helped me prep for the quiz better. 

2. **What's in your way?**
Transfering all of the issues for the Collatz project was a time consuming obstacle. I think that the new workflow solves many of the things that were in my way for this past week. 

3. **What will you do next week?**
Next week will be the start of project 2. I look forward to working with my project partner next week, brainstorming the possible implementations for the netflix recommendation algorithm. Next week will mostly be trying to implement and optimize the simplest solution to project 2. In addition I will likely brush up on my statistics knowledge and data analysis skills.

4. **What's my experience of the class?**
So far I feel that the class has been pretty good. I liked the speaker from Bloomberg, which I feel gave some very good insight into the real working world. I have a more positive outlook for the practicality of the class as project 2 looks more applicable to some scenario encountered in the working world.

5. **What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
**Tip of the Week:** A good blog summarizing various statistical models
