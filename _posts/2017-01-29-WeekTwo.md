#### Collatz Optimization

1. **What did you do this past week?**
This past week was spent working on the Collatz project and getting all the test cases to pass on hackerrank. It was an enjoyable and at times fustrating problem because of the rigorous test cases. I had to rack my brain quite a bit over finding the right optimizations, more so than I needed to debug any logical problems. It is always a great moment when all of the test cases passes after the initial attempts did not. Setting up docker and figuring out that I needed to also path the right folder to my local ssh key folder to be able to push to github also took a little time. I also did the reading for the Extreme Programming book this past week and felt that what was described made sense but would be harder to actually implement. Since even something being common sense, does not actually mean one would attempt to do so. 

2. **What's in your way?**
I found that the Extreme Programming book is more of an obstacle since there is so much more content making it a bit harder to retain in memory. So I feel that it is a minor obstacle, especially when it comes to quizzes and the exam, since we don't really directly talk about the points of the book in class.

3. **What will you do next week?**
Next week is for finishing up the Collatz project, with acceptance testing and making sure all of the items are there. Also doing the Academic integrity quiz is on the todo list. I also would have liked to start doing a personal project, but other classes have been bogging down my time. I hope since I wrote that down I would actually start the personal project now.

4. **What's my experience of the class?**
My experience of the class is postivie. Learning about the nuances of Python and how it compares to Java during lecture, I feel has been very helpful.

5. **What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
**Tip of the Week:** An article on GC in python
