1. **What did you do this past week?**
This past week I studied mainly for Test #1 and made the study sheet. I found that the content of discussion on piazza pertaining to studying for the test was really good for reviewing. I practiced a lot possible test question implementations. I did not do as well as I though I would on the test however, so that was a little disappointing. However now that I know how the test is like, I can better prepare for next time. My group also started to discuss more possible ideas for the upcoming project.

2. **What's in your way?**
Nothing is currently standing out as an obstacle.

3. **What will you do next week?**
Next week will be the planning and researching phase for the upcoming project. Our slack is pretty low key so I think my group needs to get together physically to get things moving along in a more efficient manner. Our group plans to look at more API's that are out there, and to draw up plans for how to use that data.

4. **What's my experience of the class?**
Pretty ok has been my impression so far. I like the guest speaker talks, because the industry is far different from the theory of the classroom. The quizzes were pretty accurate in helping preparing for the test. The extreme programming readings has helped me understand more towards becoming a better developer.

5. **What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
**Tip of the Week:** Thought this new database service was pretty interesting idea
