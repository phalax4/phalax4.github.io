**Great experience, awesome class, relevant material.**
The entire experience with SWE has been excellent. I definitely learned a lot about python and about new tools to use. The class is indeed intensive, but also highly rewarding. I felt that the group project had a practical aspect to it that many other CS classes fail to impart. I enjoyed going to class. Working with a partner was highly encouraged, and I found that this was also a very rewarding experience. Overall, although the class is intensive with quizzes and readings, the resulting outcome was a well worth it experience with a great professor and practical material.
