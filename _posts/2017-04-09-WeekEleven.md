1. **What did you do this past week?**
This past week was quite the mad dash to get everything in the project wrapped up for the due date. Our group got together and held a lot of planning. The real challenge we had was when we got together in the week and started to integrate everything together. I mostly did the frontend work for the project, and I did a lot of debugging for the frontend inputs and the frontend api wrapper.

2. **What's in your way?**
Our group greatly underestimated the amount of work that we had left to do, and coordination has improved but still leaves much to be desired. The main obstacle was planning all of the pieces and then fitting them together, since we mostly did each piece indepedently making integration more difficult.

3. **What will you do next week?**
Next week I would like to see a earlier start to the next phase, I will likely try to start the frontend work next week. I also plan on taking notes on the refactoring book giving it another read through.

4. **What's my experience of the class?**
The talks have been pretty informative about all the different company platforms out there, which I think isa good experience. The quizzes are a not so good experience of the class. Overall my impression of the class is that it gives only the tip of the iceberg in fullstack development, which is impressive given that everything is fit into so little time.

5. **What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
