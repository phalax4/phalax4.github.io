#### Life, oh Life
1.What did you do this past week?
This past week was spent working on the Life project and trying things out in code about objects and their inheritance behavior. Most of it was spent doing the project though, as it seems there is a lot more to consider with the Handle class. There was also lots of debugging with my partner.
2.What's in your way?
Looming tests from other classes and all of the subtley that C++ has with objects and inheritance. It can be a confusing and tricky at times with how objects behave with inheritance sometimes.
3.What will you do next week?
Finish up the Life project mostly. There are a lot of tests to write for this one like Darwin. I still need to start studying for the test but so far i have not have any time because of other classes which are also gearing up for tests and projects. I will likely try to review the book this week.
I feel like the Conway game of life is pretty cool and its neat that we get to do it as our last project. It makes really interesting patterns. Overall the class has been good, but I am still worried about the final test. OOP is still hazy to me, and a little complicated when it comes to practicing it in code like in Life.
**Tip of the Week:** If you like design patterns.
